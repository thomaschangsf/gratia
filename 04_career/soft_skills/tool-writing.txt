How to Write Goals
	- Put in sufficient details.
		* Bad examples: 
			[5/15] We are YELLOW for the date 6/30 because we discovered a critical logging error in which all click events are not logged. The $@#! logging team needs to complete the logging, and I talked to üëâ PersonX about it. Path to Green: If we don‚Äôt get the logging working by 5/25, we are going to be RED, üòü.

			Actually follow up with the team, get a JIRA. 
			If you could not follow up in time, give a Date for a Date when when you will follow up.
			Say ‚Äúworking closely with team X‚Äù because they are your partners
			In path to green, say what you are going to do, not what others need to do



Enforce high standards on written goal updates
	- PM ensures that updates
		Capture the color, date, work performed
		Have links for drill-downs, but we will not drill down during the meeting
		Include docs or JIRAs for major decisions and dates
		Includes enough information so that assignee rarely has to answer questions
	
	- Test the path to green
		Is team really able to meet the path. Is there enough buffer
		Does team have a good sense for the timeline
	
	- Why?
		Helps drive the process forward because everyone follows the rules
		Transparency is rewarded
		Fewer shorter meetings



Goals are SMART
	- Specific
		Narrows the focus to a specific, high-level work area

	- Measurable
		There is a metric that you can change, detect, and attribute to the successful completion of the work

		Even if it is only measured in an A/B test, but it should be non-trivial 

	- Assignable
		There is a SINGLE owner for the goal, i.e., for updating and tracking the updates but many may complete it

	- Realistic
		It is plausible within the time frame given resources

	- Time-bound
		Goal must be completed by a specific date, within the metrics bound

	- Avoid
		Acronyms, abbreviations. Spell them out or define them
	
		Capitalized Noun Phrases other than product names
		
		Useless goal language: ‚ÄúImprove‚Äù -- how does it change, ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù -- who cares if there is no impact, ‚ÄúInvestigate‚Äù -- deliverable is a doc, so say that
