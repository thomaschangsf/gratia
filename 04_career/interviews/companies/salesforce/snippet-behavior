- Last Minute Hints
	Please be sure to use real code (don't rely on pseudocode); code should work in a compiler.
	
	Before you begin to find your solution, take a moment to explain your approach and how you plan to solve the problem.
	
	Ask clarifying questions if you don't fully understand the problem/question being asked.
	
	Check to make sure your code works - run through at least one or two examples to check for correctness.
	
	Be receptive to any feedback from the interviewer.
	
	If you can't come up with the most refined solutions right away, you can work on the brute force solution and improve on it - but let the interviewer know that's what you're doing.
	
	If you're making assumptions as you reason through the problem, be sure to communicate those assumptions to your interviewer.
	
	Interviewers will be looking at the approach to answering questions as much as the answer: 



- Leadership
	* show examples how you resolved complex situations? 
		deal challanges in a BALANCED way?
	* How do you 
		influence
			data, trust, and empathy
		solve problems
			understand problem: why? context of problem
			
			show good judgments: 
				scoping feature
				risks: anticipate likely issues and mitigate
				appropriate metrics: OKR
			
			execution: quality, efficiency, iterate, reuse

			delivering values: communicate, evengalize, 


			strove for appropriate level of simplicity
			iterative: walk -> run

		drive improvement?
			measurable: datapipeline with metrics
			
		take ownership, but at same time move quickly?
			datapipeline with good engineering practice, design

	* Working with people & team
		* how to develp and retain team members?
		* address skill gap or personality conflict?
		* ensure team is dversve and inclusive?

- Googleyness
	* comfort with ambiguity
		How do you handle ambiguous situations?
		How do you handle projects without defined end dates?
		How to priortize multiple projects of varying complexity?
		How to balance process vs execution (flexibility and process in an agile environment)

	* bias for action
	* collobarative
	* how would you support a team to help them navigate tough challenges in a non-hierarchical team environment. What is your leadership style?

- Deliver Results
	* examples where you were the end-to-end ownder? 
		How do you evaluate the success and failure of project?
		
		[TODO] Strategies for handling competing visions on how to execute a project?
			adrate guidance with search and ads team: 2 teams in 2 divisions are tasked with delivering adrate guidance.
				meetings: brainstorm approaches,
				in the end, 1 team creaed the algo; 
					minimize waste of resource; maximize cooperation

- Why doordash?
	Mission: feels good I am helping local communiites to earn and people who can't get
	Opportunity: last mile logistics + blend digital with real world

- We are leaders
	* Be an owner: no problem is too big or small or outside of scope. We all jump in and help
		ex: guided search
		ex: NLP deployment

	* Dream big, start small: start small ideas and help them grow using data and rigorous testing.  We show evidence and double down
		ex: Layout optimization: select the type and number of modules on the search page to maximize search efficiency and revenue
			price vs item attributes: cond, leafcat, title, aspects
			data: 
				feasiblity study: rolex watch, data coverage; removed aspects
				A/B tests: 

	* We choose optimism, especially when things are tough

- We are learners
	* Seek truth: not afraid to dig in and uncover truth. Use data and common sense to solve problems
		Ex: CPS 

	* 1% better every day: seek not perfection, but constant improvement. Look for opportunity, share feedback, and celebrate growth mindset
		Ex: Look for opportunity: wanted to learn about NLP and Deep Learning bc...  	
			In companies: I advocate for projects to work with people I admire and can learn from. Seek mentorship 1-1 meeting with our tech lead.
			Outside: Took Stanford classes, personal projects

	* Consumer obsessed, not competitor ofocused
		Ex: internal customers
			M2M
		Ex: adRate Guidance

- We are doers
	* Bias for action. Launch solutions quickly, test them, and make changes because growth compunds
		Ex: 
		Ex: Adrate guidance, CPS

	* Operate at lowest level of details. 
		Ex: Very hands on.
			NLP model --> deployment --> understand K8s resource and yaml line by line; and its interdependencies

	* not either or: We don't get sucked into false dichotomies; we engineer a way to do both
		Ex: NLP R&D and deployment

- We are one team
	* Make room at the table: We're committed to growing and empowering more diverse and inclusive community.  
		Ex: In meetings I make it a point to get people's feedback and thoughts. Ex: team activities, Friday Boba

	* Think outside of the room: strive to be as inclusive

	* One team, one fight:
		Ex: ad and search.  Shared search know how with ad team. Mentored team member from the ads team. Jointed their meetings. 

		Ex: NLP deployment
