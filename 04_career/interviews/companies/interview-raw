Hi 

// ----------------------------------------------------------
// Confidence
// ----------------------------------------------------------
	- Be confident.  You are not making this up; you have done this. You need me.

	- Summary: You will be hard pressed to find someone else dedicated and passion, focused etc..  I have a plan, My action shows it.

	- Scenario: Where you disagree?
		Context: State the facts..

		Solution: Sit down, and understand&communicated the scenarios.  What are the facts? Where can we compromise. 

	- Here's what I want to do. Here;s how I would do it. But don't give all your cards away.

	- As a coach:
		Describe the problem, goal: what we are trying the accomplish; ie success criterea. Let them figure it out.  Figuring out is important. And give feedback.

	FB: 700k/4; 170k


Review staff
	5-6 rounds
		6th round is a repetitino

	5; each 45 minutess
		2 coding
		2 design
		1 behavorial

	Coding
		goal to finsih 2 medium 

		1 problem; expect to have 2 problems

		medium difficult

		practice: very basic and standard.  

		if get 1 queston, it will be difficult. not likely

		looking: 
			problem sovling, verification
			solid on fundametnals: algorithm, DS
			run time complexity, hopfully an elegant solution
			is code clean (coderpad), ie whiteboard.  
				Think of common edge casse
				Use example to walk through code
				Don't let interviews ask you, be proactive

	Design
		(1) ML Practical design
			How do you muse ml to design real problems, in fb
				ie: ad ranking, news feed ranking, recommend places based on people, detec hate speach, how to remove weapon sales

				generalize problem to sarch, recommendatoin, classification

				problem: formulate the qustion
					Purposely vauge (5 minutes)
						what does success look
						how does it impact bigger problem
						what is the ground truth
						what is the ml metrics (success) ****
						They won't give you the direct; sometimes it's gray
						if make assumption, call it out

					Goal: " I am going to frame this a ranking"

			Data
				cold start

			Features
				hoslitcally, not just oone

			Models
				model archituecture: 4 models; pros and cons
					training cost, constraints

			Offline and Online 

			Re-iterate design

			First go over breadth, and deep dive. Some poeple focust on feature engineering or model. Deep dive. Purpose is to see if you can come with alternative. Pro con. How to mitigiate piftalls. Can you justify your decision.

			Do you have a good picture

			I need to drive the conversation; run with it.
				Make sure interviewer is following your process; they will interrupt you if they want to probe more.  Assume I will be speaking 75% of time.  

				They may seem semi-adverserial

				I am offering my expertise. I am CTO; interviewer is the CEO

			
			Don't need to draw; but it may help to facillitate


		(2) System design
			Large scale distribution system

			can be fb related; 
				fb search engine; 
				suggestions

			can be a broad
				if redesign, how would you change?

			(A) Ask questions (3-5 min) (Problem exploration)
				signal: product and business sense. What is business goal. What does user really want?

			(B) Draw diagram
				5-6 boxes 
				each component has a clear responsiblity
				data flow between compoenents
				Deal with Data

			(C) Pick 1 -2 component to deep dive
				Pivot that you know better

				Come up with alternatives; pro/cons; mitigate risk; longer term

				large scale distributed: quantitive piece
					storage
					how mancy machines: back of envelop calculation: quantitive analysis

			Buffer round: 15 minutes (maybe)
				drawing tools


	Behavorial
		May ask 5 questions. Each question has about 5 minuts

		give signal at which level ($)
		
		can i be succesfful

		soft skills?

		My experiences; people 

		recent work, that you are proud of; why you are proud; your impact; what is challenging
			show scope of work: 
				collobaration with org
				leading engineers

		projects that did not do well
			ie: much longer; much more complex; design decision that I regret
			
			want to see: if not going well, can I peserver and be proactive. How to unblock.

			what did I learn? 
				growth 
				how do I do things differently

		ability to work in unstrucuture material
			bottom up; flat org; minimal process
			senior enginer identify problems; bring poeple long; and 
				vague; do not have all the data; still need to 
				how to mitigate risk
				how to communicate 
				"Tell you me a problem where you do not have that much resources"
				"Tell me a project a very vague problem; I need to drive direction; how to measutre progress; how to measure success"
				"How to communicate with "
			Work with partners
				if people have different perspective; how to drive alignment even if disagreement

		how do you resolve conflicht (will come up)
			everyone is a SW.  You should be able to work with different levels.  Conflict with other poeple; deliver feedback; sit down with p

			how to work with tough worker. why are they tough to work with
				what kinds of co-worker do you like to work with

		what is my motivation; what is my goal in this career transitin
			do you have a plan?
				do you know your strenth; weakness			
				use fb to grow
				"Tell me a recent feebdack; how do you use it grow"

		TODO:
			(1) pick your stories
				projects
				peoples
			(2) for each story, have a 2-3 poits (STAR)
				situation
					context
				what you did
				outcome/result

				interviewer may ask more probing question


		What does a good answer
			do not dodge any questions; ie never ran into any bad co-ower; be genuine
				if needed, think for 1 minute
				
			did you have relevant experience
				scope of work

			unstuructures --> 
				how do you approach; 
				drive consnesus
				show empathy: see different perspectives

				culture: open, move fast, and 
					build communities 
					ex: are you open to Feedback, inputs? 
					ex: impact: can you clearly state the impact to customer; business; across organization; how to measure sucess
					ex: be bold, move fast:  in miniaml process, you need to make a deicsion without all the data and resources.  How do you know if you can mitigate.  Do you rather move fast, and measure along the way; or do you want to wait (-)

					sginals tie to your cutuures
						peserversance
						dealint with active

		what is your workstyle
			will you be happy in FB?

Resources
	Webinar:
		kind of like the interview

	If you have specific quesiton, can talk with a ML engineer to share experience. what helped them to interview; what was must surprising. 
		Expeically design: so vaugue; how deep to dig into 


	References
		ask their experiences; work culture; they can be a good resuorces



FB
	coding is basic bar: 
		can code; clean efficient code

		passing the coding round is not sufficient

		no brain teasers; no dp; very fundamental


	design (very important)
		experience how do you use

		breadth/complete
			think first; explore the problems

		be able to justify solution

		treat ML and system design equally important. not just purely data science. 

	behavioral: spend about a weekend
		hard to fail behavioral round, but impact signals the level discussion
