But you can still slip in a sentence or two that shows you were paying attention to the conversation and noticed what was important to them
- Refer to something you learned about the role and the company during your interview. 
- Reiterate how you believe you can be a valuable contributor. 
- Did you flub a question? A follow up email is the perfect place to have a second go at it. “Having more time to consider your question about my biggest challenge, I’d like to add …” 
	You do need to keep it relatively brief, but one or two paragraphs is reasonable and gives plenty of space to elaborate and extend the conversation.
