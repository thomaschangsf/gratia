This directory contains scripts to bootstrap dev environment. 

To start, user need to do a one-time setup to overwrite their ~/.bash_profile with the one in this directory. As an example:
```
Update OPUS_DIR variable defined .bash_profile with the absolute path to the opus.git 
cp ~/Documents/dev/git/opus/10_environment/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
srcs
```
