  *
  * Monads and their operations like flatMap help us handle programs with
  * side-effects (like exceptions) elegantly.  Without it, we need alot of code to handle None case,
  * for example None/callback handling hell.
  *
  * Monad is like a design pattern. A monad is a structure that represents
  * computations defined as sequences of steps.
  *
  * Generally, it can be used in scenarios where operations can be COMPOSED
  * and each operation may have side effects(exception, IO, latency, etc).
  * Try, Future and Observable in scala are all based on monad.
  *
  * Option is another widely used monad in Scala.
  *
  * Try is the monad to handle exceptions in a functional way.
  *
  * Future enables programmers to compose asynchronous computation in an elegant way
  * while avoiding the callback hell.
  *
  * The limit of Future is that one future can only encapsulate one asynchronous result.
  * But what if thereâ€™s a stream of asynchronous events? Observable does exactly that.
  * With Observale, you can work at a very high level of abstraction
